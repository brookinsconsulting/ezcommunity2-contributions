/*!
  This class handles the chechout and payment methods. This is the
  default implementation which is meant to be used as a skeleton for
  your own specific implementation.

  To create your own checkout routine simply create a folder named checkout/
  in the eZ publish root and copy the ezcheckoutsupplier.php to the classes/
  folder of that directory. The reason for the checkout folder for custom checkout
  code is compatibility with upgrades of the software and some CVS issues.

  You will also find an example implementation of a custom checkout routine
  in the file checkout.tar.gz which is found in the custom folder of your
  eZ publish installation.
